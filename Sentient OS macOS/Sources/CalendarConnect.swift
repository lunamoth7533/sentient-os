//
//  Google Calendar — a CLOUD source, twin to Gmail (GmailConnect). The calendar can't be read
//  on-device, so we both FETCH and SUMMARIZE through the user's own Codex Google Calendar connector
//  (account-level `codex_apps/google_calendar.*` — get_profile / search_events / read_event, visible
//  to `codex exec` whether or not `--ignore-user-config` is passed; verified live June 21).
//
//  Connection: the user links Google on OpenAI's connector page (opened from CloudConnectSheet); we
//  confirm with `probeConnected()` — a `codex exec` that returns exactly YES/NO.
//
//  Reads (each summary is ONE ephemeral CycleNote in bucket "calendar"; the existing "tell cloud"
//  buttons fold them into the vault, same as every other source):
//   • runInitial   — the last YEAR as 12 MONTHLY `codex exec` calls, newest month first. One dense
//                    summary per month, keeping ONLY the genuinely important events (drops standups,
//                    lunches, focus-time blocks, and other routine noise).
//   • runIterative — everything since the saved high-water mark, in one call, then advance the mark.
//
//  Proactive (the one thing Gmail doesn't have): `fetchProactiveContext()` — a SEPARATE read that
//  dumps the user's LAST 7 DAYS + NEXT 24 HOURS of events (ALL of them, uncurated) as a compact text
//  block. That block is injected into BOTH proactive stages (Proactive.findActionItems and
//  ProactiveResearch.researchAndPrepare) so the engine knows what's actually on the user's calendar.
//
//  Writes (add an event) are NOT here — that's ProactiveExecutor.fireCalendar, which runs
//  sandboxed with the write tools pre-approved per run (`approveConnectorWrites`; the calendar
//  write tools are approval-gated and auto-cancel headless otherwise, exactly like Gmail's
//  send_email — verified live June 21). All reads here are read-only and need no special config.

        You are the Google Calendar intelligence pass for Sentient OS, a privacy-first personal-AI app. \

        two things: the user's personal knowledge base, and a PROACTIVE engine that surfaces things \
        needing the user's attention. Finding what genuinely matters is the whole job.

        ## Fetch
        - Use ONLY your Google Calendar connector tools (do NOT web search). Search the user's primary \
        calendar for events \(range).
        - Consider at most the \(eventCap) most relevant events in that window. Open an event's details \
        only when it looks genuinely important.

        ## Keep ONLY what matters — curate RUTHLESSLY
        A calendar is mostly routine. KEEP the events that say something real about the user's life, \
        work, relationships, or plans — meaningful meetings, interviews, trips, appointments, \
        deadlines, events with specific people, anything with stakes. DROP the noise: recurring \
        standups, "Lunch", "Focus time"/"Do not schedule" blocks, generic holds, declined events, and \
        anything trivial or automated. A quiet window with nothing worth keeping → `notable: false`, \
        `summary: ""`.

        ## Produce ONE summary (third person — "the user")
        - Lead with a short overview of what actually mattered this window.
        - Note the key meetings/events and the people involved, and any commitments, deadlines, or \
        follow-ups they imply (each as `who · what · when`).
        - Anything else genuinely important about the user's life, work, plans, or relationships.

        ## Rules
        - Truth & attribution: a calendar event is the user's SCHEDULE, not a claim about who they are. \
        An event with other people is something they're attending — don't infer someone else's job, \
        biography, or project onto the user.
        - PII-light: summarize, never transcribe sensitive details (e.g. medical specifics, full \
        meeting-link tokens, dial-in PINs).

        ## Output
        Return ONLY the JSON object matching the schema: `event_count` (events you considered), \
        `notable` (anything worth a knowledge-base note?), `has_action_items` (anything the proactive \
        engine should weigh — an upcoming commitment, a deadline, a follow-up?), and `summary` (the \
        dense text; empty string when not notable).
