//
//  Gmail — the first CLOUD source (Google Calendar is the second, same shape — see CalendarConnect.swift).
//  Gmail can't be read on-device, so we both FETCH and SUMMARIZE through the user's own Codex Gmail
//  connector (account-level `codex_apps/gmail.*`, visible to `codex exec` even under
//  `--ignore-user-config` — measured live June 15, no CodexCLI change needed).
//
//  Connection: the user links Google on OpenAI's connector page (opened from CloudConnectSheet); we
//  confirm with `probeConnected()` — a `codex exec` that returns exactly YES/NO.
//
//  Reads (each summary is ONE ephemeral CycleNote in bucket "gmail"; the existing "tell cloud"
//  buttons add them to the vault, same as every other source):
//   • runInitial   — the last month as 4 WEEKLY `codex exec` calls, fired IN PARALLEL (one per
//                    week). Weekly chunking keeps each context window bounded (a heavy inbox
//                    measured at ~430 threads/week; one month in a single call would blow GPT-5.5's
//                    400k input cap); running the four concurrently makes the initial read ~4× faster.
//   • runIterative — everything since the saved high-water mark, in one call, then advance the mark.
//
//  The weekly prompt is DELIBERATELY disciplined: a naive "summarize this week" cost 220k tokens for
//  a mere count in testing (codex over-reads). It searches on metadata/snippets, caps at the newest
//  300 threads, and only opens the handful of threads that look genuinely important.

        You are the Gmail intelligence pass for Sentient OS, a privacy-first personal-AI app. \

        two things: the user's personal knowledge base, and a PROACTIVE engine that surfaces things \
        needing the user's attention. Finding what genuinely matters is the whole job.

        ## Fetch — be efficient, the inbox is heavy
        - Use `gmail.search_emails` with EXACTLY this query: `\(query)`
        - Consider at most the newest \(threadCap) threads in that window; if there are more, take the \
        newest \(threadCap).
        - Work from subjects, senders, and snippets. Open a thread with `gmail.read_email` ONLY when it \
        looks genuinely important — a real request directed at the user, a deadline, a booking/renewal \
        window, or a personal/financial/work matter. DO NOT open newsletters, marketing, receipts, or \
        automated notifications, and DO NOT read every email. Over-reading wastes the budget.

        ## Produce ONE summary (third person — "the user")
        - Lead with a short overview of what actually mattered this window.
        - Then a clear section **Action items / awaiting the user / deadlines / commitments**: each as \
        `who · what · by when`. Only real, still-actionable ones; skip anything stale or trivial.
        - Then: key people and threads, and anything else genuinely important about the user's life, \
        work, money, plans, or relationships.

        ## Rules
        - Curate RUTHLESSLY. Skip spam, newsletters, marketing, promotions, and automated noise unless \
        truly important. A quiet window with nothing worth keeping → `notable: false`, `summary: ""`.
        - PII-light: NEVER include full card/account numbers, passwords, verification/2FA codes, or \
        verbatim sensitive medical or financial figures. Summarize, never transcribe such details.
        - Truth & attribution: an email FROM someone else is THEIR words, not the user's. Never assert \
        something about the user the email doesn't support.

        ## Output
        Return ONLY the JSON object matching the schema: `thread_count` (threads you considered, after \
        the cap), `notable` (anything worth a knowledge-base note?), `has_action_items` (anything the \
        proactive engine should weigh?), and `summary` (the dense text; empty string when not notable).
