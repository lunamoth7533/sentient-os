//
//  CommandRunModel.swift
//  Sentient OS macOS
//
//  Runs ONE "do this for me" task through the user's codex (computer use), streaming codex's latest
//  output line(s) into `statusLine`. `stop()` cancels the run (CodexCLI terminates codex). One run at a time.
//
//  Every way to start a task — the home command bar, the right-⌘ hotkey, AND a proactive card's
//  fire, any channel (which ADOPTS this run via adoptExternal/externalPush/completeExternal) — drives
//  the SAME instance (owned by CommandCoordinator), so the prompt bar, the notch, and the card are all
//  views of one run, and `isRunning` is the app-wide one-task-at-a-time lock. `onFinished` lets the
//  coordinator move the notch from running → finishing. Everything also tees to Log()
//  (tail /tmp/sentient-dev.log). Doc: Documentation/Notch Magic/.
//
//  Key methods: start(_:mode:) · stop() · adoptExternal(caption:onStopRequest:) ·
//  commandPrompt(task:mode:screenshots:spoken:).

        You will not be able to ask me follow-up questions to clarify: in this harness, the moment you stop responding I see the task attempt as completed. So don't stop to ask trivial follow-up questions. Either do the task, or if it's genuinely way too ambiguous to act on (like in case of critical TTS fumble), just stop. No follow-up questions are possible.
