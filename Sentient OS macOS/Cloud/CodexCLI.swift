//  CodexCLI.swift
//  Sentient OS macOS
//
//  The `codex exec` wrapper service — the compute spine for ALL cloud-model work:
//  vault generation, daily updates, proactive intelligence. Discovers the user's Codex CLI
//  binary, validates it with a quick ping, and runs headless prompts via `Process`:
//  prompt over STDIN (never argv — macOS ARG_MAX is 1 MB), `--json` JSONL events back,
//  sandbox/effort/cwd scoping, and typed usage-limit errors that carry the session (thread)
//  id so callers can reschedule and resume. All mechanics receipt-verified live (receipts in
//  the doc below).
//
//  Key methods:
//   - CodexCLI.locateBinary()  → binary discovery (managed install first, then cache/known paths/which)
//   - install(onLine:)         → run OpenAI's standalone installer (the codex-setup onboarding step)
//   - startLogin / loginStatus → step 2: interactive `codex login` (browser) + the status check
//   - validate(force:)         → Availability via ping (only a good verdict is cached)
//   - run(_:)                  → Envelope (blocking JSONL mode)
